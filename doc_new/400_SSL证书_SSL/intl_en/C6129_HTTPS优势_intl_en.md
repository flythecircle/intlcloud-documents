An encrypted HTTP protocol based on the SSL certificate enables the site to be switched from HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer), for secure data transmission based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

Advantages for sites applying HTTPS:

### 1. Anti-traffic hijacking
Applying HTTPS for the whole website is a solution to eradicate traffic hijacking by ISPs and intermediaries, which can prevent advertisements displayed in web pages, and protect user privacy.

### 2. Improving Search Rankings
HTTPS can help improve search rankings, credibility and brand image of websites.

### 3. Avoiding Phishing Websites
The green icon on HTTPS address bar helps users identify phishing websites, which protects the interests of users and businesses, and enhances users' trust in websites.
